## Brief

The working class has gotten a raw deal for the entity of the United States of America social experiment.

While the promise of freedom and democracy brought the masses to the new world, the truth is that - from the beginning - the entire economic platform of the United States was designed to benefit the wealthy class and subjugate the rest.

The capitalist class has continued to build this country into a system of networks that strictly benefit the capitalist class by providing faster means and more convenience to administering slavery; when more laborers are needed, infrastructure must support it.


##### What, exactly, does that labor-supporting infrastructure look like?

It looks like faster transportation to move workers quicker to their labor. The transportation's safety is not of concern. But speed and the quantity of laborers moved at a time are top priority. Safety is too detrimental to efficiency.

It looks like a manufacturing process akin to Henry Ford's assembly line, but scaled up to encompass the entire world; sourcing, processing, and shipping materials, creating smaller components and products at one point in the global factory assembly line, then moved to another factory to be assembled into another product or component, and all eventually coming together into another product. At each stage, a cost of profit added to each component and each stage of labor and production.

It looks like factory farming and cruelty to animals to support centralized food production and the chains of agriculture vendors and shipping. Food that is subsidized for mass-manufacturing because it's cheap, even though it's not healthy. The health of the labor class is not important when there's enough to be disposable. Cheaper food means less cost to the laborer, which makes them further dependent on the cheaper food; a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It looks like an education system that provides enough of a basic education to make a laborer useful to the capitalist class, but not enough to threaten the capitalist class's power and control. They don't want competition. They want drones. Cheap, effective, and obedient drones.

It looks like a healthcare system designed to keep laborers just healthy enough to make sure they're still productive, but only to the point that the cost of keeping them productive doesn't cost more than the value they generate for the capitalist class.

It looks like an information system, disguised as a watchdog service, to inform the labor class of what the capitalist class has agreed the laborers should be concerned with, and provide the facade that the labor class has any relevance, authority, or choice over what the capitalist class has already set in motion. It divides the masses of laborers against each other for the sole purpose of keeping them from recognizing walls of the invisible prison they're locked in.

It looks like a legal system mired in low-level corruption, designed to keep the laborers from understanding that such corruption starts at the laborer level, not the capitalist level; a judicial system that acts as a ratchet for making austerity legal and justice a fantasy, demoralizing and depressing the labor class. Officers of the law, given impunity over the treatment of the labor class, given the means to oppress, and given the motive for oppression. Smaller, localized prisons are constructed by the capitalist class to hold those who have been deemed “cheaper labor” through a purposeful loophole created in the constitution which allows the form of freedom the rest of the labor class believes doesn’t exist anymore. A legislative system, working solely for the capitalist class, from the most localized government bodies to the highest level of federal government, to steal any remaining value they discovered, oppress any descent of the capitalist agenda, and ultimately support the total control of the entire planet by the capitalist class.

It looks like an economic system that uses a fiat currency to control laborers. The capitalist class manipulates the currency to always keep the labor class from obtaining generational wealth. They create boom-bust cycles to take away the fake value they allow the labor class to create. The real value was already stolen by the capitalist class, and the laborers were given currency as an IOU for their labor. They allow labor to invest, spend, or save those IOUs throughout the entire labor-support infrastructure.


##### The biggest part of the capitalist grift:

The whole point of the labor infrastructure is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">to support the laborers in creating the value the capitalist class will steal away</span> from the laborers. But they force the laborers PAY for that infrastructure's costs with those very same IOUs in currency. The result of this system is that the capitalist class has no cost as it tricks the labor class into paying for its own austerity. The capitalist class has done no work, but absorbed ~100% of all created value with virtually no risk.

But this is not enough for the capitalist class: they want more. The goal is not only to own everything, but to own everyone as well. To achieve this, the capitalist class has learned that if they give a little up front, they'll gain back a literal lifetime of unearned debt repayment from the laborers. This is how they have made the laborers indentured servants: Reduce the IOUs issued and artificially increase the cost in IOUs of using and maintaining the labor-supporting infrastructure.

As fewer currency IOUs are issued to the laborers, the laborers now must find other ways to pay for the ever-increasing cost of the infrastructure they've been locked into: credit.

The capitalist class _lends_ back to the laborers a tiny fraction of the value they've stolen from the laborers to further pay into the infrastructure, but laborers must accept that they'll be required to pay back more than they took. For vast majority of the laborers that borrow from credit, it becomes impossible to payback and locks the laborers into a cycle of paying back the value borrowed with the remainder of IOUs they receive from their labor, only to be forced to borrow it back when they don't have IOUs left after that payment. Eventually, interest builds over time and the laborers become bankrupt, leading to liquidations and repossessions - the laborer loses many years of value to the capitalists who trapped them. Keep in mind that the capitalist class borrows currency IOUs from each other, too. But as they’re operators of the system, they do not incur interest the same way a laborer does. In most cases, the top of the capitalist class do not pay any interest at all; in some cases even have negative interest rates. This is something the labor class will never be able to take advantage of.

What we have, in effect, is a limited number of people, the capitalist class, that provide no value to the world of laborers, but they live as if they own and control 100% of all value created by the labor of the billions. They effectively own more than 90% of all capital of this world. They live above the laws of the laborer class because they instituted these laws. They do not have consequences when their actions negatively impact only the labor class. They do not have remorse for the death, pain, and hardships their greed inflicts on the labor class.

To the capitalist class, the laborers are no more than batteries. Just like batteries, there are different qualities, features, and costs. The same applies to the labor class: Just because a laborer gets more IOUs than other laborers does not mean that they’re part of the capitalist class; they’re just laborers that the capitalists value more for their agenda; still expendable and disposable.


### The Logistics-Infrastructure Collective

There are many categories of infrastructure. There’s the human infrastructure, which comprises human resources like educators, fire fighters, medical professionals, etc. There’s utility infrastructure, which comprises services and utilities like power, water, communications, gas, etc.

Then there’s the logistical infrastructure, which is the one we’ll discuss here. The logistics infrastructure comprises the systems of transporting people and tangible goods, and the costs and resources are required to achieve it.

The thing about logistics is that it is the system that enables capitalism in modern times: If you cannot move product, you cannot sell it. Who is going to buy a TV if they can’t also take it home? How will a factory make that TV if they cannot get the parts to manufacture it? How will the parts vendors get the materials they need to make TV components if they can’t get the raw materials?

In addition to this question, there’s the reality that this labor-supporting infrastructure has many weaknesses: most businesses with physical locations (nearly all businesses) pay a lease to a company that likely has a mortgage on the commercial space. Everyone, somehow, is indebted to a bank. And that bank is likely indebted to the government central bank.

That means it’s obligatory for any business that intends to stay solvent and not lapse on its own obligations or endanger its legal status, **it must generate revenue**.

To summarize this: The government loans money to banks, banks loan money to real estate businesses to purchase commercial space for other businesses to lease, other businesses purchase materials which are shipped through the infrastructure and sell products using the infrastructure, to pay for commercial space leased by real estate businesses, which then pay back banks, who then pay back the government.


##### But what happens when you remove the logistical infrastructure?

A laborer walks into a store to buy a can of soup. Unfortunately, there isn’t a can of soup to buy. That can of soup wasn’t shipped from the soup making factory. That’s because the soup was never made. The soup factory didn’t have the materials to make the soup, nor the empty cans to put the soup in, nor the trucks to move the soup cans if there were any to move.

The factory didn’t have cans because they were never shipped. They were never shipped because the can-making factory didn’t have any raw materials to make the cans because there was nobody to ship them. They didn’t have the vegetables because the farms didn’t have trucks to move the produce from the farms.

Well, it seems the laborer isn’t going to buy a can of soup, nor anything else because that store doesn’t have anything to sell. That store will not make enough money to pay for their lease. The leasing company will not have enough money for their mortgage. The mortgaging bank will not have enough money to pay back their loan to the government.

Of course, this is a very simplified view of this logistical infrastructure and how it affects the capitalist economy.

It is evident that the actual weakness in this system is that laborers who believe they’re _not_ laborers (we can call them the “landlord class”), are still part of the laborer class. This means they are locked into the same rules of economics as the rest of the laborer class. They do not have the system of support the true capitalist class has developed for themselves; a “too big to fail” code of conduct that reassures the capitalist class that any failure on their part will be passed on to the labor class to bear the burden of failure, and the capitalist will be made right again. The landlord class, instead, must work within the boundaries of the entire labor-supporting infrastructure designed for them. That means a collapse of the landlord class would cause further harm and collapse to the labor class. This is precisely what we saw when the 2008 financial crisis happened: The capitalists were bailed out by the labor class, the landlord class was crushed - even pushed into bankruptcy (illegally at times), and the laborers were thrown into desperate situations where they could not earn IOUs or shelter their families.

The landlord class is no more than just low-level managers of the labor class for the capitalist class. The landlord class works to squeeze what IOUs they can from the laborers, keeping laborers from being able to invest their IOUs further into the infrastructure in a beneficial way. In a sense, the capitalist class oppresses the landlord class, while both the capitalist class and landlord class oppresses the labor class. This makes the landlord class the useful idiots and tools of the capitalists. But I digress.

In the end, the removal of the logistical infrastructure will cause a quick and painful collapse of this delicate infrastructure. The implications of this sort of disruption would not only stop nearly all tangible-good manufacturers from making money on already-paid-for production, but may even put a short (but possibly temporary) end to meaningless waste like endless war.

We saw this a limited form of this effect when the COVID pandemic threw so much of the nation into lockdowns, while legislators and industry worked to make “essential workers”, the bottom of the pyramid that actually does the labor, except from lockdowns to ensure industry and business does not completely collapse.

A total shutdown of logistics/shipping would strike at the very heart of capitalism.


### How do we do it?

We know where the weaknesses are in the existing system. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The capitalist class has put the entire burden of running the planet on the laborers, but convinced the laborers that the capitalist class controls it.</span>

_They do not._

The laborers control everything except the flow of money. However, the flow of money stops when everything else stops. So let’s discuss the main systems used to move goods throughout the nation:


##### Railroads

When the railroad workers union threatened to go on strike, the nation’s industry leaders cried out to the US government to intervene because the strike would <span style="text-decoration:underline;">potentially</span> lead to a $2 billion per day loss in economic output <sup>[[1]](#sources)</sup>. If _just_ the railroad strike on its own would cost the economy $2 billion dollars, what would a logistics infrastructure strike cost the economy?


##### Truckers

In 2022, the US/CA “Freedom Convoy” which saw truckers block a vital bridge for logistics and cargo stopped approximately $360 million worth of goods being shipped <span style="text-decoration:underline;">per day</span> <sup>[[2]](#sources)</sup>. This was only in a localized area and mostly prevented the auto manufacturers from receiving the parts they needed to manufacture cars and trucks. That was just the economic impact on mostly 1 industry for a single choke point.

The US trucking industry moves approximately 70% of the US’s tangible goods. When the trucker shortage started affecting the logistics industry, the US economy went into a tailspin. The shortage of truckers was a catalyst for massive inflation hikes around the world <sup>[[3]](#sources)</sup>. This was just from a shortage of truckers, not a total shutdown of trucking.


##### Air Freight

The US exports $2.2 trillion dollars in goods each year. Air freight on its own accounts for over $640 billion of the US annual GDP <sup>[[4]](#sources)</sup>. Air freight is a key component of US exports. Without air freight, US industries would have to rely on shipping via ocean freight, which is generally slower in every way.


#### The Logistics Infrastructure Strike

A logistics infrastructure strike would effectively manifest itself as multiple related unions striking in solidarity with the entire nation.

Laborers that are not members of these unions would support the strike by donating resources to the cause, be it time, money, food, or other resources the unions can disburse.


##### Cause and Effect

If the trucker union strikes, this will cause the ocean freight system to come to a complete halt, as the trucker shortage demonstrated in 2021; major shipping ports were clogged and backlogged for months, forcing cargo ships to drop anchor off the coasts while queued for unloading.

In addition, nearly all factories in the US will be unable to produce any product until truckers are able to both ship in materials and ship out produced goods. This affects every major manufacturer in the country. At this point, since the trucker strike would block ocean shipping, US companies who manufacture their products _outside_ of the country will not be able to import their products to sell. This leaves no room for sales or profit for any US manufacturer.

If the rail laborers go on strike, 80% of the nation’s agricultural traffic will come to a complete stop, blocking factory farms - especially - from receiving the necessary raw materials they need to produce food and ship it to the rest of the country.

If the air freight laborers go on strike, industries will lose their final option for moving products and goods. In addition, air freight is commonly used for medical supplies, perishables, and urgent deliveries. This accounted for approximately $108 billion in air freight revenue in 2020 alone.


#### Unions

Unions are the life force of this plan. They are structured and practiced in the ways of striking and bargaining. We benefit from the collective action of all of the unions together. Just as a union makes collective bargaining possible for the individual people, unionizing the unions makes collective bargaining possible for all of the unions together.

To convince all of the unions to work with us, they must be represented in our fight. If our values are not their values, we must make their values (at least as many as possible) our values, too. This plan represents us all.

The first point of order, I believe, is to discuss and work with the Freight Division of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union whether they would join us in this plan. We must hear out what they want, and find both the overlap and common ground.

We must do this for all of the applicable unions. We must contact union leaders and representatives to discuss how and when we can make this call to action most effective. We must know when freight and shipping is its most busy, where the most costly shipping and logistics occur, and how to limit economic throughput.


#### Reality

The fact is, unions or not, this nation runs on labor and there's no replacement for us, even with automation.
